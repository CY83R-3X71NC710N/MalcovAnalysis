# MalcovAnalysis

MalcovAnalysis is a project created with Python to detect malicious code in a text file. The project utilizes Python's re module to search for malicious code, generate alerts for potentially malicious code strings, and leverage Naive Bayes classifier algorithms and regular expression libraries to identify malicious code. This project is a work in progress and is intended to be built upon to make it into what it was designed to become.

## Project Goals
The goal of the MalcovAnalysis project is to create a powerful tool to detect malicious code in a text file. This tool will be able to recognize malicious code in a wide variety of languages, including Python, JavaScript, and HTML. The tool will also be able to generate alerts for potentially malicious code strings.

## Features
- Utilize Python's re module to search for malicious code
- Generate alerts for potentially malicious code strings
- Leverage Naive Bayes classifier algorithms and regular expression libraries to identify malicious code
- Create a prototype that can be built off and extended to become more powerful

## Project Roadmap
The project roadmap for MalcovAnalysis is as follows:
- [x] Create a prototype
- [ ] Improve accuracy of Naive Bayes classifier algorithms
- [ ] Increase the variety of languages supported
- [ ] Create a GUI for the project
- [ ] Implement machine learning algorithms for better detection of malicious code

## APIs Used
The project uses a few closed-source APIs. These APIs are still in development and will likely not be released to the public due to licensing agreements. Therefore, if you would like to use MalcovAnalysis, you should create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs.
